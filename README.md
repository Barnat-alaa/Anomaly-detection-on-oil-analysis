Anomaly detection on oil analysis

This project imports oil data from all mining sites of DTP Mining and filters the research to only focus on Epiroc D60/D65.
The first part of this project is to clean the data. In this project, I use 4 anomaly detection techniques: Isolation Forest, Robust Covariance, One-Class SVM (SGD), and One-Class SVM.
These anomaly detection techniques are implemented on key indicators of the oil analysis results that can detect anomalies in specific compartments of the engine.


After implementing and visualizing each technique, I use Isolation Forest to show and export alerts to a CSV file.
